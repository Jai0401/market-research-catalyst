# Resource Links for Agriculture Use Cases

Use Case 1: Predictive Crop Yield Optimization: Predict crop yields to optimize resource allocation and improve overall yield. GenAI/ML can be applied by training ML models on historical data and using GenAI to generate synthetic data. Benefits include increased crop yields, reduced waste, and improved decision-making.
